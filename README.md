# Next.js Blog Starter
A custom Next.js blog starter for use with [`create next app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). This starter design is based on the original blog starter provided by Next, but includes many extra features and performance improvements that are nice to have right out of the box.

Run this in your terminal to get started:

```shell
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/sandypockets/nextjs-blog-starter/tree/main nextjs-blog-starter
```

## Get started
This README will guide you through the basic set up. However, please refer to the blog posts in the [live demo](https://github.com/sandypockets/nextjs-blog-starter#live-demo) for more information. Don't worry, no lorem ipsums here. Each post contains real, actually helpful content. 

Built and tested with Node `v20.11.1`

### Create Next App
1. Bootstrap this starter using `create next app`.
```shell
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/sandypockets/nextjs-blog-starter/tree/main nextjs-blog-starter
```

2. Change into the new project directory and install dependencies.
```shell
cd nextjs-blog-starter && npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

5. Once the server is running, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
6. Set up constant variables, and prepare to generate a sitemap.
7. [Set up Google Analytics](https://github.com/sandypockets/nextjs-blog-starter#set-up-google-analytics)
8. [Set up SendGrid](https://github.com/sandypockets/nextjs-blog-starter#set-up-sendgrid).

### Constants

Set up each of the constants, much like you would a `.env`, in the `lib/constants.js` file.   

```javascript
export const EXAMPLE_PATH = 'blog-starter'
export const CMS_NAME = 'Markdown'
export const HOME_OG_IMAGE_URL = 'https://og-image.vercel.app/Next.js%20Blog%20Starter%20Example.png?theme=light&md=1&fontSize=100px&images=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Ffront%2Fassets%2Fdesign%2Fnextjs-black-logo.svg'
export const BLOG_NAME = 'Next.js Blog Starter'
export const KEYWORDS = 'starter, blog, next.js, template'
export const DESCRIPTION = 'A starter blog template for Next.js'
export const AUTHOR = 'sandypockets'
export const LANG = 'en-CA'
export const GITHUB_REPO = 'https://github.com/sandypockets'
```

### Generate a sitemap and robots.txt

Sitemaps are an important part of SEO. This section walks through adding your base URL to the sitemap generator. The generator runs automatically after each build, generating a new sitemap each time you update your blog. 

The generated sitemap can be found in `public/sitemap.xml`. This command also generates a new `public/robots.txt` file.

1. Open the `scripts/generate.sitemap.mjs` file.
2. On Line 5, replace `https://blog-starter.sandypockets.dev` with your own blog's website.
3. On Line 6, replace `en-CA` with your preferred locale (`en-UK`, `en-US`, etc.). This is used to determine the format of the date stamp in the sitemap.  

When you're ready to test it:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Check the `public/` directory for the `sitemap.xml` file and `robots.txt` file.
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`

If you see the xml sitemap, then it was successful.

### RSS Feed
An RSS feed is available for the blog at `/feed.xml`. However, you must first configure the RSS generator to use your own URL.

1. Open the `scripts/generate-rss.mjs` file.
2. On Line 7, replace the `https://blog-starter.sandypockets.dev` value of `BLOG_URL` with your own.

When you're ready to test it:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Check the `public/` directory for the `feed.xml` file.
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/feed.xml`

If you see the xml RSS feed, then it was successful.

### Set up Google Analytics

You will need to have your Google tag ID. If you do not have one, or do not have a Google Analytics account, you can sign up at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/)

1. Create a copy of the `.env.local.example` file, and name it `.env.local`. To do so in the terminal, run:

```shell
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

2. Grab your Google tag ID from your Analytics account, and replace the `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in the new `.env.local` file you just created.

### Set up SendGrid
You will need a free SendGrid account, which allows you to send up to 100 emails each day.

1. Get your SendGrid API key from your SendGrid account.
2. Open the `.env.local` file that you created when setting up Google Analytics.
3. Replace `REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual API key from SendGrid.

## Customize Syntax Highlighting
When you use inline code or codeblocks on your blog, they'll be highlighted with the Dracula theme style, like this:

![dracula prism syntax highlighting](./docs/dracula-syntax-highlighting.png)

However, you can choose from [over 38 other themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) that are ready to go right out of the box. 

### Changing the theme
1. Open the `pages/_app.js` file.
2. On Line 5, note the import of `'prism-themes/themes/prism-dracula.css'`
3. To change the theme, simply replace the `prism-dracula.css` portion with the name of the new theme file as shown [on this page](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/tree/master/themes).

For example, if you want to use the `prism-duotone-sea` theme, then adjust the import statement on Line 5 to be `import 'prism-themes/themes/prism-duotone-sea.css'`

## How it works
Blog posts are stored in the `/_posts` directory as Markdown files. Each post must include the appropriate front matter. 

To create the blog posts we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.

### Front matter
An example of the required front matter:

> Note: The formatting of the front matter is important. Ensure the indentation, and quotes remain the same. 

```text
---
title: 'A blog starter you actually want to use'
excerpt: 'There are hundreds of different blog starters out there. But none felt quite right. So I built my own. Based off the basic Next.js Blog Starter, but now with several handy features like dark mode (using local storage) or Google Analytics. It comes with Storybook too.'

```

Adjust the value of each key as needed.

### Create a new article
There are two ways to create a new article: manually, or using the included script to scaffold one out. 

#### Using the script
First, you should replace the placeholder `sandypockets` information in the `scripts/generate-post.js` script with your own info. Then, it's as simple as running the script: 

```shell
npm run new your-post-title
```

The script will generate a new post in the `/_posts` directory with the title used in the command above, and a default front matter.

#### Create a new article manually
1. Add a new Markdown file (`.md`) to the `/_posts` directory. 
2. Add the required front matter (described above) and adjust it as needed. 
3. Images related to the post should be stored in within the appropriate the `/public/assets/blog` directory. It is recommended you create a new folder for each blog post to prevent the images files from growing unwieldy. 
4. That's it. Your new post will show up alongside the others on your homepage. 

> Note: The slug is the path that will be displayed, and is based on the title of your `.md` file. For example, `kobe.md` becomes `localhost:3000/posts/kobe`
